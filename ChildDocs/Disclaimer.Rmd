\begin{small}
The following disclaimer is provided to clarify the limitations and cautionary
considerations associated with the interpretation of microbiome data. While
microbiome analysis has the potential to provide valuable insights into an
individual's health and well-being, it is important to recognize the
complexities and uniqueness of each person's microbiome composition.
\end{small}

\subsection{Individual Variability}
\begin{small}
Every individual possesses a distinct microbiome composition, influenced by a
multitude of factors. As a result, the interpretation of microbiome data should
be approached with caution. There are no universally applicable standards or
thresholds for defining a "healthy" or "unhealthy" microbiome. The composition
of your microbiome can vary over time due to a number of factors, including
diet, medication, illness, stress, and lifestyle changes. Consequently, a single
snapshot of the microbiome cannot provide a comprehensive representation of any
individual's long-term microbial profile or health status.  
\end{small}

\subsection{Limited Knowledge}
\begin{small}
Despite significant advancements in microbiome research, our understanding of
the complex interactions and functions of microbial communities within the human
body is still evolving. The scientific community continues to explore and
uncover new aspects of the microbiome, so interpretations of
microbiome data are subject to change as additional knowledge emerges.

If you have concerns about your microbiome or health, it is essential to consult
a qualified healthcare professional. While microbiome analysis holds promise for
understanding human health, it is important to acknowledge the individuality and
complexity of each person's individual situation. Interpretations of microbiome
data should be approached with caution, recognizing the limitations and the need
for ongoing research and professional guidance.
