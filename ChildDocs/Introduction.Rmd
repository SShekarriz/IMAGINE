\section{Introduction}

The human gut is home to hundreds of species of microbes, mostly bacteria. In
fact, the human gut has as many bacterial cells as there are human cells in your
whole body! This microbial community is known as your 'gut microbiome'.

The gut microbiome has several very important roles to play in keeping us
healthy. It helps us to break down and digest the food that we eat, produces
vitamins that we require, trains and maintains our immune system, and serves as
the first line of defense against infection from bacteria that could do us harm.

We are still very much at the beginning of understanding all the things the gut
microbiome does, how our actions and environment affect it, and how we can use
it to keep people healthier and living longer. The MAGIC study (a sub-study of
the IMAGINE study that you are participating in) is an ambitious project to

improve our understanding of how three important variables (genes, diet, and
mental health) impact the gut microbiome in people with inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and in turn how all four
factors together impact the disease course.


\subsection{Studying the microbiome}

A key component of the MAGIC study is generating microbiome profiles for each
participant in the study. So, how do we do that?

Bacteria, just like plants and animals, can be grouped together into closely
related groups called **species**. Those species can then be grouped together
into bigger groups called **genera** (singular: genus), and genera can be
grouped together into **families**, and so on up the tree of life. 

Each bacterial species has a unique genetic "barcode" that can be used to
identify it. To determine the composition of each sample's microbiome, we
extract the DNA from your stool sample and then isolate and sequence these
bacterial DNA barcodes. We don't sequence any human DNA, just the bacterial
barcodes. We generate 10,000 to 50,000 barcode sequences per sample. Each
sequence is then labeled with its taxonomic identity (which species, genus,
family, etc. it belongs to) and the number of bacteria present in each species
is counted.

You can think of the bacteria in your gut like a jar of jelly beans. The barcode
tells us what colour each jelly bean is, and the number of times we see that
barcode in our sequences tells us how many jelly beans there are of that colour.
This allows us to sort the bacteria into species and generate the "taxonomic bar
chart" you'll see in this document.

As there are hundreds of species in a sample, we quickly run out of colours!
Therefore, we will use the categories at the genus or family level, and also
only display the bacteria that are abundant enough to show up clearly on the
chart.

These microbiome profiles are only the beginning. We use the information in them
to compare profiles between healthy controls and people with IBD/IBS, and to
investigate ways that a person's microbiome changes with their health status. We
also try to identify individual microbes that might be associated with specific
illnesses. Understanding these associations between our microbes and our health
will lead to new treatments that target the microbiome directly: increasing
"good" bacteria and decreasing "bad" bacteria.
