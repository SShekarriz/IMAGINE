Families	description
Lachnospiraceae	This family of bacteria is found in the gut and plays an important role in the breakdown of complex carbohydrates. Lachnospiraceae are known for their ability to ferment a variety of dietary fibers, producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as butyrate, propionate, and acetate. These SCFAs provide an energy source for the body, improve gut health, and have anti-inflammatory properties. Research has also linked Lachnospiraceae to improved metabolic health and a reduced risk of obesity.
Ruminococcaceae	Ruminococcaceae are involved in the fermentation of dietary fiber and the production of SCFAs. These bacteria also play a role in regulating the immune system and maintaining gut health. Research has shown that reduced levels of Ruminococcaceae in the gut are associated with inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
Bacteroidaceae	Bacteroidaceae is a family of bacteria found in the gut that are involved in the breakdown of complex carbohydrates, such as dietary fibers and resistant starches. These bacteria produce enzymes that can break down plant-based foods, making the nutrients more accessible to the body. Bacteroidaceae also play a role in regulating the immune system and maintaining gut health, and their presence has been associated with a reduced risk of inflammatory bowel diseases.
Peptostreptococcaceae	Peptostreptococcaceae are anaerobic bacteria that are commonly found in the gut microbiome. These bacteria are involved in the breakdown of amino acids and fermentation of carbohydrates, producing short-chain fatty acids, gases, and other metabolites. Peptostreptococcaceae also play a role in the production of essential vitamins such as biotin and folate, and their presence has been linked to a healthy gut microbiome.
Erysipelatoclostridiaceae	Members of the Erysipelatoclostridiaceae family of bacteria are known for their ability to produce beneficial compounds such as butyrate, which has been shown to promote gut health and have anti-inflammatory properties. Some species of Erysipelatoclostridiaceae are also involved in the degradation of complex carbohydrates, producing SCFAs that provide energy for the body.
Akkermansiaceae	Akkermansiaceae is a family of bacteria found in the gut that is associated with the production of the mucin layer, which protects against harmful pathogens and maintains a healthy gut environment. These bacteria are also involved in the breakdown of complex carbohydrates and the production of SCFAs such as acetate and propionate, which have anti-inflammatory properties and may improve metabolic health.
Oscillospiraceae	Members of the Oscillospiraceae family of bacteria have been linked to improved glucose metabolism and may have a role in regulating blood sugar levels. These bacteria are involved in the breakdown of complex carbohydrates and the production of SCFAs such as butyrate, which have been shown to improve gut health and protect against inflammation.
Rikenellaceae	Rikenellaceae is a family of bacteria found in the gut that has been associated with the production of anti-inflammatory compounds and may help protect against metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes. These bacteria are involved in the fermentation of dietary fiber and the production of SCFAs such as butyrate and propionate.
Enterobacteriaceae	Enterobacteriaceae is a family of bacteria commonly found in the gut that includes several pathogenic species such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella. However, some species of Enterobacteriaceae are beneficial to human health. For example, some strains of E. coli produce vitamin K2, which is important for bone health and may have other health benefits. Other species of Enterobacteriaceae are involved in the breakdown of complex carbohydrates and the production of SCFAs, which provide energy for the body and improve gut health.
Christensenellaceae	Members of the Christensenellaceae family of bacteria are associated with a healthy gut microbiome and have been linked to a reduced risk of obesity. These bacteria may play a role in regulating the immune system and improving gut health.
Bifidobacteriaceae	Bifidobacteriaceae are commonly found in the gut and are known for their ability to produce lactic acid, which helps to maintain an acidic environment in the gut that is unfavorable to harmful bacteria. These bacteria are also involved in the breakdown of complex carbohydrates and the production of SCFAs such as acetate and lactate, which provide energy for the body and improve gut health.
Eubacterium	Members of the [Eubacterium] coprostanoligenes group of bacteria are involved in the production of cholesterol-lowering compounds called coprostanol and ursodeoxycholic acid. These bacteria may play a role in reducing the risk of heart disease and other conditions associated with high cholesterol levels.
Clostridiaceae	Clostridiaceae is a family of bacteria that includes several species that are beneficial to human health. These bacteria are involved in the fermentation of dietary fiber and the production of SCFAs, which provide energy for the body and improve gut health. Some species of Clostridiaceae have also been linked to a reduced risk of inflammatory bowel diseases.
Streptococcaceae	Streptococcaceae is a family of bacteria commonly found in the mouth and gut that have a variety of beneficial roles. Some species of Streptococcaceae are involved in the production of essential vitamins such as folate and vitamin K, while others are involved in the breakdown of complex carbohydrates and the production of SCFAs.
Monoglobaceae	Members of the Monoglobaceae family of bacteria are involved in the fermentation of dietary fiber and the production of SCFAs, which provide energy for the body and improve gut health. These bacteria may also play a role in regulating the immune system and maintaining a healthy gut microbiome.
Tannerellaceae	Tannerellaceae is a family of bacteria that includes several species associated with improved gut health. These bacteria are involved in the breakdown of complex carbohydrates and the production of SCFAs such as butyrate, which has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties and protect against colon cancer.
Veillonellaceae	Veillonellaceae is a family of bacteria commonly found in the mouth and gut that have a variety of beneficial roles. Some species of Veillonellaceae are involved in the production of SCFAs, while others are involved in the breakdown of amino acids and the production of essential vitamins such as biotin.
