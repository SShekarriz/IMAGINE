\subsection{Peptostreptococcaceae}

\begin{small}
Peptostreptococcaceae are anaerobic bacteria that are commonly found in the gut
microbiome. These bacteria are involved in the breakdown of amino acids and
fermentation of carbohydrates, producing short-chain fatty acids, gases, and
other metabolites. Peptostreptococcaceae also play a role in the production of
essential vitamins such as biotin and folate, and their presence has been linked
to a healthy gut microbiome.
