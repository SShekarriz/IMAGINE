Akkermansiaceae is a family of bacteria found in the gut that is associated with
the production of the mucin layer, which protects against harmful pathogens and
maintains a healthy gut environment. These bacteria are also involved in the
breakdown of complex carbohydrates and the production of SCFAs such as acetate
and propionate, which have anti-inflammatory properties and may improve
metabolic health.
