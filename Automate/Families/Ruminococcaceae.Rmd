\subsection{Ruminococcaceae}

\begin{small}
Ruminococcaceae are involved in the fermentation of dietary fiber and the
production of SCFAs. These bacteria also play a role in regulating the immune
system and maintaining gut health. Research has shown that reduced levels of
Ruminococcaceae in the gut are associated with inflammatory bowel diseases such
as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
