\subsection{Bacteroidaceae}

\begin{small}
Bacteroidaceae is a family of bacteria found in the gut that are involved in the
breakdown of complex carbohydrates, such as dietary fibers and resistant
starches. These bacteria produce enzymes that can break down plant-based foods,
making the nutrients more accessible to the body. Bacteroidaceae also play a
role in regulating the immune system and maintaining gut health, and their
presence has been associated with a reduced risk of inflammatory bowel diseases.
