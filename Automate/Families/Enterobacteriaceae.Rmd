\subsection{Enterobacteriaceae}

\begin{small}
Enterobacteriaceae is a family of bacteria commonly found in the gut that
includes several pathogenic species such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella.
However, some species of Enterobacteriaceae are beneficial to human health. For
example, some strains of E. coli produce vitamin K2, which is important for bone
health and may have other health benefits. Other species of Enterobacteriaceae
are involved in the breakdown of complex carbohydrates and the production of
SCFAs, which provide energy for the body and improve gut health.
