\subsection{Bifidobacteriaceae}

\begin{small}
Bifidobacteriaceae are commonly found in the gut and are known for their ability
to produce lactic acid, which helps to maintain an acidic environment in the gut
that is unfavorable to harmful bacteria. These bacteria are also involved in the
breakdown of complex carbohydrates and the production of SCFAs such as acetate
and lactate, which provide energy for the body and improve gut health.
