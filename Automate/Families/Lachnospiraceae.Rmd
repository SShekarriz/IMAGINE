\subsection{Lachnospiraceae}

\begin{small}
This family of bacteria is found in the gut and plays an important role in the
breakdown of complex carbohydrates. Lachnospiraceae are known for their ability
to ferment a variety of dietary fibers, producing short-chain fatty acids
(SCFAs) such as butyrate, propionate, and acetate. These SCFAs provide an energy
source for the body, improve gut health, and have anti-inflammatory properties.
Research has also linked Lachnospiraceae to improved metabolic health and a
reduced risk of obesity.
