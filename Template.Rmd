## Introduction

INTRODUCTION TO MICROBIOME AND TO THE IMAGINE STUDY

## Your Sample

This bar chart shows your personal fecal bacterial community. 
Bacteria are grouped into **families** based on how closely related
they are.

The bar chart is stacked from most abundant bacterial family on the 
bottom, to least abundant on the top, with very low-abundance 
bacteria grouped together as "Other". Next to it is a chart showing
the average community of all the people who participated in the study,
and across the bottom are four anonymous individuals chosen to show
the range of variation in this study. As you can see, it's quite wide!

```{r PlotSetup}
wcdf = (my_df
        %>% group_by(Family, Genus)
        %>% summarize(Abundance = 100*sum(Abundance))
        %>% filter(Genus != 'Other', 
                   !grepl('.*_.*',as.character(Genus)))
        %>% arrange(desc(Abundance)))

```

This word cloud shows your personal bacterial community at a finer 
level of detail. Within each family, bacteria can be subdivided into 
several **genera** (singular, **genus**). The size of each word
represents the relative abundance of that genus, and the colour shows
which family that genus comes from.

## You Are Here

There were over 1,000 people participating in this study! We have 
graphed everyone together based on how similar or different their gut
microbiomes were. In the next graph, points that are closer together
are more similar to each other, and points that are farther apart are
more different. Your sample is shown in green. Remember that your 
position in this graph doesn't say anything about how healthy your
gut microbiome is. As we've seen above, there is a wide range of 
normal variation in the human gut.

```{r, fig.width=3, fig.height=3, fig.align='center'}
my_bray_df = filter(bray_df, Study_ID == samp)
my_bray_plt = bray_plt +
    geom_point(data = my_bray_df, colour = '#4b9b79', alpha = 1,
               size = 2) +
    geom_point(data = my_bray_df, colour = '#4b9b79', alpha = 0.5,
               size = 4)
